%
% Finds connected components in a graph defined by the adjacency matrix A.
% The function outputs an n-vector of integers 1:k in blocks, meaning that
% A has k components. The vector blocks labels the vertices of A according 
% to component.
% If the adjacency matrix A is undirected (i.e. symmetric), the blocks are 
% its connected components. If the adjacency matrix A is directed (i.e. 
% unsymmetric), the blocks are its strongly connected components.

    % Check size of adjacency matrix

    % Compute Dulmage-Mendelsohn permutation on A
    if ~all(diag(A)) 
        [foo, p, bar, r] = dmperm(A | speye(size(A)));
    else
        [foo, p, bar, r] = dmperm(A);  
    end

    % Compute sizes and number of clusters
    sizes = diff(r);

    % Now compute the array blocks
    blocks = zeros(1, n);
    blocks(r(1:k)) = ones(1, k);
    blocks = cumsum(blocks);

    % Permute blocks so it maps vertices of A to components
