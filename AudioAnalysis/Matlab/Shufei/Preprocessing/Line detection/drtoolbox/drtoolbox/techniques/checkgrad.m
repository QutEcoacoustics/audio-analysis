function d = check(f, X, e, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6);

% checkgrad checks the derivatives in a function, by comparing them to finite
% differences approximations. The partial derivatives and the approximation
% are printed and the norm of the diffrence divided by the norm of the sum is
% returned as an indication of accuracy.
%
% usage: checkgrad('f', X, e, P1, P2, ...)
%
% where X is the argument and e is the small perturbation used for the finite
% differences. and the P1, P2, ... are optional additional parameters which
% get passed to f. The function f should be of the type 
%
% [fX, dfX] = f(X, P1, P2, ...)
%
% where fX is the function value and dfX is a vector of partial derivatives.
