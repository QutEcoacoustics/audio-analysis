# Package information
The non-negative matrix factorisation algorithm is implemented in MATLAB. 

# Use the package
Download the package from [NMFlib](http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~grindlay/code.html#NMFlib) or from https://github.com/audiofilter/nmflib
Add the folder path into MATLAB working directory.

# Examples
*preprocess.m Read the audio file, convert into spectrogram, and remove low and high frequency components
*NMF_decompose.m Do non-negative matrix factorisation with a self-determined factorisation rank r
*run_NMF.m A loop function to process multiple files and save the results
