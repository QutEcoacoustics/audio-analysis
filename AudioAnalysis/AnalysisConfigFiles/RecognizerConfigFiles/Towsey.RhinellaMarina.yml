# Minimum and maximum duration for the length of a true advertisement call.
# As of 4 June 2015, the Code for Canetoad recogniser was changed to include recognition of release calls.
# The min duration setting of 5 seconds should not be changed because it is boundary between advert calls ( >5s duration) and release calls (<5s duration).
# The min duration for a release call will be set = to the DCT duration in the code.

MaxDuration: 30.0
# Event threshold - use this to determine FP / FN trade-off for events.
