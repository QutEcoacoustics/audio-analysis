# This config is fairly general for frog calls having a HONK architecture.
# i.e. a brief single honk having a dominant frequency and one or more harmonics - evenly spaced.
# The algorithm is copied from Algorithm2 of the PlatyplectrumOrnatum recognizer.

AnalysisName: Towsey.UperoleiaLithomoda
SpeciesName: Uperoleia lithomoda
AbbreviatedSpeciesName: U.lithomoda

# User does not have control over the window size. This must be fixed by recognizer.

# The Uperoleia lithomoda call has three major peaks. The dominant peak is at 1850 or as set above.
# The second and third peak are at equal gaps below. i.e. dominantFreq-gap and dominantFreq-(2*gap);
# Set the gap here: should be in range 880 to 970
DominantFrequency: 3000

# Threshold Cosine-similarity to a in-line call template: Similarity must exceed this threshold. 
EventSimilarityThreshold: 0.6
# Decibel SNR threshold for the dominant peak: use this to determine FP / FN trade-off for events.
EventDecibelThreshold: 20.0
