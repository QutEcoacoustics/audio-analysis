# Summary: Calculates acoustic indices at high temporal resolution, i.e. every 0.1 - 0.2 seconds
#
# The csv files this analysis outputs can be used to construct:
#     1. long-duration false-color spectrograms
#     2. a focused stack of zooming false-color spectrograms
#     3. the tiles for zooming false-color spectrograms

# BgNoiseNeighbourhood: units=seconds (default IndexCalculationDuration = 60 seconds)
# BG noise for any location is calculated by extending the region of index calculation from 5 seconds before start to 5 sec after end of current index interval.
#    Ten seconds is considered a minimum interval to obtain a reliable estimate of BG noise.
#    The  BG noise interval is not extended beyond start or end of recording segment.
#    Consequently for a 60sec Index calculation duration, the  BG noise is calculated form the 60sec segment only.
