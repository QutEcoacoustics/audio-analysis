AbbreviatedSpeciesName: L.convex

# min and max of the freq band to search
MinHz: 850          
DominantFrequency: 1850
# The Limnodynastes convex call has three major peaks. The dominant peak is at 1850 or as set above.
# The second and third peak are at equal gaps below. i.e. dominantFreq-gap and dominantFreq-(2*gap);
# Set the gap here: should be in range 880 to 970
PeakGap: 470 
# Event threshold - use this to determine FP / FN trade-off for events. Unites = dB
EventThreshold: 10.0
