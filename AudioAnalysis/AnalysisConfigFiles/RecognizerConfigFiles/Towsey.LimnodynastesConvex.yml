# The Limnodynastes convex call has three major peaks. The dominant peak is at 1850 or as set above.
# The second and third peak are at equal gaps below. i.e. dominantFreq-gap and dominantFreq-(2*gap);
# Set the gap here: should be in range 880 to 970
DominantFrequency: 1850

# Possible future additional parameters to control required call characteristics.
# PeakGap: 470 
# MinHz: 850 

# Decibel threshold for the dominant peak: Use this to require a minimum decibel SNR value for a valid call.
PeakThreshold: 10.0
# Event threshold - use this to determine FP / FN trade-off for events. CosineSimilarity to template in 0,1.
EventThreshold: 0.2
