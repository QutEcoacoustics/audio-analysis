# min and max of the freq band to search
MinHz: 850          
DominantFrequency: 1850
# The Limnodynastes call has three major peaks. The dominant peak is at 1850 or as set above.
# The second and third peak are at equal gaps below. i.e. dominantFreq-gap and dominantFreq-(2*gap);
# Set the gap here: should be in range 880 to 970
PeakGap: 470 
# duration of DCT in seconds 
#DctDuration: 0.75
# minimum acceptable value of a DCT coefficient
#DctThreshold: 0.45
# ignore oscillation rates below the min & above the max threshold
# OSCILLATIONS PER SECOND
#MinOcilFreq: 7        
#MaxOcilFreq: 20
# Event threshold - use this to determine FP / FN trade-off for events. Unites = dB
EventThreshold: 10.0
