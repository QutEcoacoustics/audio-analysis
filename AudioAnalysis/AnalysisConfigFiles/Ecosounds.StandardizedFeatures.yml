# IndexCalculationDuration: units=seconds (default=60 seconds; use 0.1 for zooming spectrogram tiles)
# The Timespan (in seconds) over which summary and spectral indices are calculated
IndexCalculationDuration: 30.0

# BgNoiseNeighbourhood: units=seconds (default IndexCalculationDuration = 60 seconds)
# BG noise for any location is calculated by extending the region of index calculation from 5 seconds before start to 5 sec after end of current index interval.
#    Ten seconds is considered a minimum interval to obtain a reliable estimate of BG noise.
#    The  BG noise interval is not extended beyond start or end of recording segment.
#    Consequently for a 60sec Index calculation duration, the  BG noise is calculated form the 60sec segment only.
BgNoiseNeighbourhood: 5

# Resample rate must be 2 X the desired Nyquist
ResampleRate: 22050

# FRAME LENGTH. units=samples
# FrameWidth is used without overlap to calculate the spectral indices. Typical value=512
