AnalysisName: Ecosounds.StandardizedFeatures
#SegmentDuration: units=minutes;

#SegmentOverlap: units=seconds;
SegmentOverlap: 0

# BgNoiseNeighbourhood: units=seconds (default IndexCalculationDuration = 60 seconds)
# BG noise for any location is calculated by extending the region of index calculation from 5 seconds before start to 5 sec after end of current index interval.
#    Ten seconds is considered a minimum interval to obtain a reliable estimate of BG noise.
#    The  BG noise interval is not extended beyond start or end of recording segment.
#    Consequently for a 60sec Index calculation duration, the  BG noise is calculated form the 60sec segment only.
BgNoiseNeighbourhood: 5

# Resample rate must be 2 X the desired Nyquist
ResampleRate: 22050

# FRAME LENGTH. units=samples
# FrameWidth is used without overlap to calculate the spectral indices. Typical value=512
FrameLength: 512


#Default values in code are LowFreqBound=1000Hz & MidFreqBound=8000
LowFreqBound: 1000
MidFreqBound: 8000
HighFreqBound: 11000

# FrequencyScale options are currently only Linear and Octave
# Octave scale is to be used only for Jasco Marine recordings @ sample rate = 64000
FrequencyScale: Linear
