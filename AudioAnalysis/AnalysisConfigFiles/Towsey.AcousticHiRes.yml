# Summary: Calculates acoustic indices at high temporal resolution, i.e. every 0.1 - 0.2 seconds
#
# The csv files this analysis outputs can be used to construct:
#     1. long-duration false-color spectrograms
#     2. a focused stack of zooming false-color spectrograms
#     3. the tiles for zooming false-color spectrograms

#SegmentDuration: units=minutes;     SegmentOverlap: units=seconds;
SegmentDuration: 1
SegmentOverlap: 0

# IndexCalculationDuration: units=seconds (default=60 seconds; use 0.1 or 0.2 for hi-resolution, zooming spectrogram tiles)
# The Timespan (in seconds) over which summary and spectral indices are calculated
IndexCalculationDuration: 1.0

# BGNoiseNeighbourhood: units=seconds (default IndexCalculationDuration = 60 seconds)
# BG noise for any location is calculated by extending the region of index calculation from 5 seconds before start to 5 sec after end of current index interval.
#    Ten seconds is considered a minimum interval to obtain a reliable estimate of BG noise.
#    The  BG noise interval is not extended beyond start or end of recording segment.
#    Consequently for a 60sec Index calculation duration, the  BG noise is calculated form the 60sec segment only.

# FRAME LENGTH. units=samples
# FrameWidth is used without overlap to calculate the spectral indices. Typical value=512

# FrequencyScale options are currently only Linear and Octave
# Octave scale is to be used only for Jasco Marine recordings @ sample rate = 64000
