Overall framework architecture and style was greatly inspired by AForge.NET. The AForge.NET
Framework is a copyrighted work by Andrew Kirillov. This framework (Accord.NET) is in no way

This library also contains routines adapted from Lutz Roeder's Mapack for .NET, LAPACK and Jama
routines. Jama has been released under the public domain. LAPACK has been released under a compatible
3-clause BSD license, listed below. Original ArrayDataView code is copyright (c) 2004 Mihail Stefanov,
licensed under the LGPL with permission of the original author. Original SortableBindingList source
code is copyright (c) 2008 Tim Van Wassenhove, licensed under the LGPL with permission of the original
author. Statistics module contains code for computing the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distribution based on
original code by Richard Simard, redistributed under the LGPL with permission of the original author.

The Accord.Vision module includes definitions for Haar Cascades created by Modesto Castrillon-Santana,
distributed under the LGPL with permission of the original author. The SURF interest points detector
implementation is based on code by Christopher Evans, licensed under the LGPL with permission of the
original author. The FAST corners detector has been created using a code generation tool created by
Edward Rosten, distributed under a compatible 3-clause BSD license, listed below. The Camshift tracker
implementation is based on the FaceIt ActionScript Camshift tracker, copyright (c) 2009 Benjamin Jung,
