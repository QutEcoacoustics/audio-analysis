========================================

Hello,

My name is Matt Perdeck. I am the author of the LinqToCsv library. I (belatedly) decided to put the library on NuGet, but then I saw that you had already done so! I'm flattered you found it that useful :-)

The issue is that I've decided to do some updates to the library over the coming weeks (just completed the first one), and I want to turn those updates into NuGet packages and put them on NuGet. This would also affect the description of the library on NuGet.

To make this all happen, would you like to share the login details of the NuGet account you're using for the LinqToCsv entry, so I can do the updates? Alternatively, would you be prepared to make the updates on my behalf?

If you want proof of my identity, I can provide that if you want.

Thanks in response for your reply,

Matt Perdeck
