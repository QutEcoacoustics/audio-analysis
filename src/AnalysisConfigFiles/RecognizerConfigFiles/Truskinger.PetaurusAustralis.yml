#################### POST-PROCESSING of EVENTS ###################

PostProcessing:
    PostProcessInDecibelGroups: false
# # The following generic post-processing steps are determined by config settings.
# # Step 1: Combine overlapping events - events derived from all profiles.
# # Step 2: Combine possible syllable sequences and filter on excess syllable count.
# # Step 3: Remove events whose bandwidth is too small or large.
# # Step 4: Remove events that have excessive noise in their side-bands.
