#################### POST-PROCESSING of EVENTS ###################

# A: First post-processing steps are to combine overlapping/proximal/sequential events 
#  1: Combine overlapping events
#CombineOverlappingEvents: false

#  2: Combine each pair of Boobook syllables as one event
CombinePossibleSyllableSequence: true
SyllableStartDifference: 0.6
SyllableHertzGap: 350

#  3: Combine events that are likely to be repetitions of the same syllable.
CombineProximalSimilarEvents: false

# B: Remaining post-processing steps are to filter out over/undersize events
#  4: Filter the events for duration in seconds
RemoveEventsHavingWrongDuration: true

#  5: Filter the events for bandwidth in Hertz
RemoveEventsHavingWrongBandwidth: true

# C: Options to save results files
#  6: Available options for saving data files (case-sensitive): [False/Never | True/Always | WhenEventsDetected]
SaveIntermediateWavFiles: Never
SaveIntermediateCsvFiles: false
# Available options (case-sensitive): [False/Never | True/Always | WhenEventsDetected]
# "True" is useful when debugging but "WhenEventsDetected" is required for operational use.

#  7: Available options for saving 
#SaveSonogramImages: True
SaveSonogramImages: WhenEventsDetected
# DisplayCsvImage is obsolete - ensure it remains set to: false
DisplayCsvImage: false
