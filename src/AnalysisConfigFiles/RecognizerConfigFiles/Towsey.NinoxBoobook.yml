#################### POST-PROCESSING of EVENTS ###################

# A: First post-processing steps are to combine overlapping/proximal/sequential events 
#  1: Combine overlapping events
#CombineOverlappingEvents: false

#  2: Combine each pair of Boobook syllables as one event
#     Can also use this to "mop up" events in neighbourhood - these can be removed later. 
CombinePossibleSyllableSequence: true
SyllableStartDifference: 0.6
SyllableHertzGap: 350

# B: Select or remove event types.
#  3: Select wanted event types.
#SelectEventsOfType: !ChirpEvent

#  4: Remove unwanted event types.
#RemoveEventsOfType: !ChirpEvent 

# C: Remaining post-processing steps are to filter out over and/or undersized events
#  5: Filter the events for duration in seconds
RemoveEventsHavingWrongDuration: true

#  6: Filter the events for bandwidth in Hertz
RemoveEventsHavingWrongBandwidth: true

#  7: Filter the events for excess activity in upper buffer zone
RemoveEventsHavingExcessActivityInUpperBufferZone: true

#  8: Filter the events for excess activity in lower buffer zone
RemoveEventsHavingExcessActivityInLowerBufferZone: true

# C: Options to save results files
#  9: Available options for saving data files (case-sensitive): [False/Never | True/Always | WhenEventsDetected]
SaveIntermediateWavFiles: Never
SaveIntermediateCsvFiles: false
# Available options (case-sensitive): [False/Never | True/Always | WhenEventsDetected]
# "True" is useful when debugging but "WhenEventsDetected" is required for operational use.

#  10: Available options for saving 
#SaveSonogramImages: True
SaveSonogramImages: WhenEventsDetected
# DisplayCsvImage is obsolete - ensure it remains set to: false
DisplayCsvImage: false
