#################### POST-PROCESSING of EVENTS ###################

# The first two post-processing steps are to combine overlapping/proximal/sequential events 
#  1: Combine overlapping events
CombineOverlappingEvents: true

# 2: Combine possible syllable sequences
#    Can also use this to "mop up" events in neighbourhood - these can be removed later. 
SyllableSequence:
    CombinePossibleSyllableSequence: true
    SyllableStartDifference: 0.6
    SyllableHertzGap: 350
    FilterSyllableSequence: true
    SyllableMaxCount: 2
    ExpectedPeriod: 0.4 

# 3: Remove events whose bandwidth lies outside 3 SDs of an expected value.
ExpectedBandwidth: 280
BandwidthStandardDeviation: 40

# 4: Filter the events for excess activity in their upper and lower buffer zones
NeighbourhoodLowerHertzBuffer: 150

# C: Options to save results files
#  4: Available options for saving spectrograms (case-sensitive): [False/Never | True/Always | WhenEventsDetected]
# "True" is useful when debugging but "WhenEventsDetected" is required for operational use.
#SaveSonogramImages: True
SaveSonogramImages: WhenEventsDetected

#  5: Available options for saving data files (case-sensitive): [False/Never | True/Always | WhenEventsDetected]
SaveIntermediateWavFiles: Never
SaveIntermediateCsvFiles: false

# 6: DisplayCsvImage is obsolete - ensure it remains set to: false
DisplayCsvImage: false
