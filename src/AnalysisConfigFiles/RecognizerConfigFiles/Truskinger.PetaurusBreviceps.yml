#################### POST-PROCESSING of EVENTS ###################

PostProcessing:
# # The following generic post-processing steps are determined by config settings.
# # Step 1: Combine overlapping events - events derived from all profiles.
# # Step 2: Combine possible syllable sequences and filter on excess syllable count.
# # Step 3: Remove events whose bandwidth is too small or large.
# # Step 4: Remove events that have excessive noise in their side-bands.

    # 1: Combine overlapping events
    CombineOverlappingEvents: true

    # 2: Combine possible syllable sequences
    SyllableSequence:
        CombinePossibleSyllableSequence: true
        SyllableStartDifference: 0.8
        SyllableHertzGap: 100
        FilterSyllableSequence: true
        SyllableMaxCount: 4
        ExpectedPeriod: 0.8

#     # 3: Remove events whose duration lies outside 3 SDs of an expected value.
#     #Duration:
#         ExpectedDuration: 0.14
#         DurationStandardDeviation: 0.01

#     # 4: Remove events whose bandwidth lies outside 3 SDs of an expected value.
#  #   Bandwidth:
#         ExpectedBandwidth: 280
#         BandwidthStandardDeviation: 40

#     # 5: Filter the events for excess activity in their sidebands, i.e. upper and lower buffer zones
#     SidebandActivity:
#         LowerHertzBuffer: 150
#         UpperHertzBuffer: 400
#         MaxAverageSidebandDecibels: 3.0
