#################### POST-PROCESSING of EVENTS ###################

# A: First post-processing steps are to combine overlapping/proximal/sequential events 
#  1: Combine overlapping events
#CombineOverlappingEvents: false

#  2: Combine each pair of Boobook syllables as one event
#     Can also use this to "mop up" events in neighbourhood - these can be removed later. 
CombinePossibleSyllableSequence: true
SyllableStartDifference: 3.0
SyllableHertzGap: 35

#  B: Filter the events for excess activity in their upper and lower buffer zones
LowerHertzBuffer: 150
UpperHertzBuffer: 400

# C: Options to save results files
#  4: Available options for saving data files (case-sensitive): [False/Never | True/Always | WhenEventsDetected]
SaveIntermediateWavFiles: Never
SaveIntermediateCsvFiles: false
# Available options (case-sensitive): [False/Never | True/Always | WhenEventsDetected]
# "True" is useful when debugging but "WhenEventsDetected" is required for operational use.

#  5: Available options for saving 
#SaveSonogramImages: True
SaveSonogramImages: WhenEventsDetected
# DisplayCsvImage is obsolete - ensure it remains set to: false
DisplayCsvImage: false
