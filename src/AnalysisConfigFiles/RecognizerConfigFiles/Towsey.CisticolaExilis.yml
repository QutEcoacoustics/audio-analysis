#################### POST-PROCESSING of EVENTS ###################

PostProcessing:
# The following generic post-processing steps are determined by config settings.
# Step 1: Combine overlapping events - events derived from all profiles.
# Step 2: Combine possible syllable sequences and filter on excess syllable count.
# Step 3: Remove events whose bandwidth is too small or large.
# Step 4: Remove events that have excessive noise in their side-bands.

    # 1: Combine overlapping events
    CombineOverlappingEvents: true

    # 2: Combine possible syllable sequences
    SyllableSequence:
        CombinePossibleSyllableSequence: true
        SyllableStartDifference: 0.11

        FilterSyllableSequence: true
        SyllableMaxCount: 2

    # 3: Remove events whose duration lies outside 3 SDs of an expected value.

 #   Bandwidth:

    # 5: Filter the events for excess activity in their sidebands, i.e. upper and lower buffer zones

# Options to save results files
# 1: Available options for saving spectrograms (case-sensitive): [False/Never | True/Always | WhenEventsDetected]
# "True" is useful when debugging but "WhenEventsDetected" is required for operational use.
#SaveSonogramImages: True
SaveSonogramImages: WhenEventsDetected

# 2: Available options for saving data files (case-sensitive): [False/Never | True/Always | WhenEventsDetected]
SaveIntermediateWavFiles: Never
SaveIntermediateCsvFiles: false

# 3: DisplayCsvImage is obsolete - ensure it remains set to: false
