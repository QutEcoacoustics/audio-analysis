# Australasian Bittern = Botaurus poiciloptilus
#NOTE: The parameter values in this config file were optimised on a data set supplied by Elizabeth Znidersic.
#      It consisted of 14 consecutive hours of recording from Medeas Cove, St. Helens, Tasmania.
#      The recordings contained 55 Bittern calls.
#      Recall = 76%. Precision = 88%.

# Resample rate must be 2 X the desired Nyquist
ResampleRate: 8000
# SegmentDuration: units=seconds;    
SegmentDuration: 60
# SegmentOverlap: units=seconds;
SegmentOverlap: 0

# Each of these profiles will be analyzed
# This profile is required for the species-specific recogniser and must have the current name.

#################### POST-PROCESSING of EVENTS ###################

PostProcessing:
# The following generic post-processing steps are determined by config settings.
# Step 1: Combine overlapping events - events derived from all profiles.
# Step 2: Combine possible syllable sequences and filter on excess syllable count.
# Step 3: Remove events whose bandwidth is too small or large.
# Step 4: Remove events that have excessive noise in their side-bands.

    # 1: Combine overlapping events
    CombineOverlappingEvents: true

    # 2: Combine possible syllable sequences
    SyllableSequence:
        CombinePossibleSyllableSequence: true
        SyllableStartDifference: 3.0
        SyllableHertzGap: 35
        FilterSyllableSequence: true
        SyllableMaxCount: 6
        ExpectedPeriod: 2.5

    # 3: Remove events whose bandwidth lies outside 3 SDs of an expected value.
    Bandwidth:
        ExpectedBandwidth: 100
        BandwidthStandardDeviation: 15

    # 4: Filter the events for excess activity in their sidebands, i.e. upper and lower buffer zones
    SidebandActivity:
        LowerHertzBuffer:  0 #150
        UpperHertzBuffer: 0 #400
        DecibelBuffer: 2.0

# Options to save results files
# 1: Available options for saving spectrograms (case-sensitive): [False/Never | True/Always | WhenEventsDetected]
# "True" is useful when debugging but "WhenEventsDetected" is required for operational use.
#SaveSonogramImages: True
SaveSonogramImages: WhenEventsDetected

# 2: Available options for saving data files (case-sensitive): [False/Never | True/Always | WhenEventsDetected]
SaveIntermediateWavFiles: Never
SaveIntermediateCsvFiles: false

# 3: DisplayCsvImage is obsolete - ensure it remains set to: false
DisplayCsvImage: false
