#################### POST-PROCESSING of EVENTS ###################

PostProcessing:
# # The following generic post-processing steps are determined by config settings.
# # Step 1: Combine overlapping events - events derived from all profiles.
# # Step 2: Combine possible syllable sequences and filter on excess syllable count.
# # Step 3: Remove events whose bandwidth is too small or large.
# # Step 4: Remove events that have excessive noise in their side-bands.

#     # 1: Combine overlapping events
    CombineOverlappingEvents: false

#     # 2: Combine possible syllable sequences
    SyllableSequence:
        CombinePossibleSyllableSequence: true

        # FilterSyllableSequence: true
        # SyllableMaxCount: 2
        ExpectedPeriod: 0.150

#     # 3: Remove events whose duration lies outside 3 SDs of an expected value.
