# Second version adapted to generic recognizer format by Anthony Truskinger
SpeciesName: Pteropus
CommonName: Flying Fox

# Proposed Approach:
#    Typically the lowest harmonic will lie between 1200 Hz and 3000 Hz and the higher ones evenly spaced.
#    This is the tricky bit due to variability but may work to use spectrum auto-correlation.
