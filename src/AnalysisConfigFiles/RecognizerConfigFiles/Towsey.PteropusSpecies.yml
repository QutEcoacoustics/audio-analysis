#Proposed Approach:
#1. Assume that a long recording has been broken into one-minute segments.
#2. Convert each one-minute segment to a spectrogram.
#3. Obtain a noise profile for each segment. This is to be used later to remove insect chorusing.
#4. Scan the one-minute waveform and select "spike maxima" whose amplitude exceeds a decibel threshold, D.
#5. Extract a single frame (say 512 samples) centred on each spike and convert to a spike spectrum.
#6. Subtract the noise profile from the spike spectrum.
#7. Smooth the remaining spectrum.
#8. Look for evenly spaced harmonics in the smoothed spectrum.
#    Typically the lowest harmonic will lie between 1200 Hz and 3000 Hz and the higher ones evenly spaced.
#    This is the tricky bit due to variability but may work to use spectrum auto-correlation.
