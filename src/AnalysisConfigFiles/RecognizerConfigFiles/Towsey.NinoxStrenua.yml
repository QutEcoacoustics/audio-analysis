# Powerful Owl = Towsey.NinoxStrenua

# The parameters in this recognizer config have been tuned based on recordings provided by Kristen Thompson, DPI, NSW.
# She suggests that separate recognizers should be prepared for male and female calls due to their difference in frequency.
# The female calls seem pretty consistent between 450-550Hz. Often the first pulse is lower with the second pulse higher.
# The male calls vary in frequency. Some are low at around 350Hz and donâ€™t have the higher second pulse ...
#    ... but some do and the highest that will go is 430Hz.


# Resample rate must be 2 X the desired Nyquist
#ResampleRate: 22050
# SegmentDuration: units=seconds;    
SegmentDuration: 60
# SegmentOverlap: units=seconds;
SegmentOverlap: 0

# Each of these profiles will be analyzed
# This profile is required for the species-specific recogniser and must have the current name.

#################### POST-PROCESSING of EVENTS ###################

PostProcessing:
# The following generic post-processing steps are determined by config settings.
# Step 1: Combine overlapping events - events derived from all profiles.
# Step 2: Combine possible syllable sequences and filter on excess syllable count.
# Step 3: Remove events whose bandwidth is too small or large.
# Step 4: Remove events that have excessive noise in their side-bands.

    # 1: Combine overlapping events
    CombineOverlappingEvents: true

    # 2: Combine possible syllable sequences

# "True" is useful when debugging but "WhenEventsDetected" is required for operational use.

SaveSonogramImages: WhenEventsDetected

# 2: Available options for saving data files (case-sensitive): [False/Never | True/Always | WhenEventsDetected]
