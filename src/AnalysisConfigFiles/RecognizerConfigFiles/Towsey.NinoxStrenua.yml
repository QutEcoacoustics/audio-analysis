# Powerful Owl = Towsey.NinoxStrenua

# The parameters in this recognizer config have been tuned based on recordings provided by Kristen Thompson, DPI, NSW.
# She suggests that separate recognizers should be prepared for male and female calls due to their difference in frequency.
# The female calls seem pretty consistent between 450-550Hz. Often the first pulse is lower with the second pulse higher.
# The male calls vary in frequency. Some are low at around 350Hz and donâ€™t have the higher second pulse ...
#    ... but some do and the highest that will go is 430Hz.


# Resample rate must be 2 X the desired Nyquist
#ResampleRate: 22050
# SegmentDuration: units=seconds;    
SegmentDuration: 60
# SegmentOverlap: units=seconds;
SegmentOverlap: 0

# Each of these profiles will be analyzed
# This profile is required for the species-specific recogniser and must have the current name.
