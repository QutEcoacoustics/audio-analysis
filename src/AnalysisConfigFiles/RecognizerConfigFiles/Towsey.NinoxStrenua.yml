#################### POST-PROCESSING of EVENTS ###################

# The first two post-processing steps are to combine overlapping/proximal/sequential events 
# 1: Combine overlapping events
CombineOverlappingEvents: true

# 2: Combine possible syllable sequences
SyllableSequence:
    CombinePossibleSyllableSequence: true
    SyllableStartDifference: 1.4
    SyllableHertzGap: 300
    FilterSyllableSequence: true
    SyllableMaxCount: 6
    ExpectedPeriod: 0.92 # this figure derived from measure of 12 syllable periods.

# 3: Remove events whose bandwidth lies outside 3 SDs of an expected value.
ExpectedBandwidth: 150
BandwidthStandardDeviation: 15

# 4: Filter the events for excess activity in their sidebands, i.e. upper and lower buffer zones
NeighbourhoodLowerHertzBuffer: 100
NeighbourhoodUpperHertzBuffer: 600
#NeighbourhoodDecibelBuffer: 18.0  # use this value if not combining sequences
NeighbourhoodDecibelBuffer: 9.0   # use this value when combining sequences

# Options to save results files
# 5: Available options for saving spectrograms (case-sensitive): [False/Never | True/Always | WhenEventsDetected]
# "True" is useful when debugging but "WhenEventsDetected" is required for operational use.
#SaveSonogramImages: True
SaveSonogramImages: WhenEventsDetected

# 6: Available options for saving data files (case-sensitive): [False/Never | True/Always | WhenEventsDetected]
SaveIntermediateWavFiles: Never
SaveIntermediateCsvFiles: false

# 7: DisplayCsvImage is obsolete - ensure it remains set to: false
DisplayCsvImage: false
