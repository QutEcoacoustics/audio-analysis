# The Limnodynastes convex call has three major peaks. The dominant peak is at 1850 or as set above.
# The second and third peak are at equal gaps below. i.e. dominantFreq-gap and dominantFreq-(2*gap);
# Set the gap here: should be in range 880 to 970
DominantFrequency: 1850

# Threshold Cosine-similarity to a in-line call template: Similarity must exceed this threshold.
EventSimilarityThreshold: 0.6
# Decibel SNR threshold for the dominant peak: use this to determine FP / FN trade-off for events.
EventDecibelThreshold: 20.0
