#################### POST-PROCESSING of EVENTS ###################

PostProcessing:
# The following generic post-processing steps are determined by config settings.
# Step 1: Combine overlapping events - events derived from all profiles.
# Step 2: Combine possible syllable sequences and filter on excess syllable count.
# Step 3: Remove events whose bandwidth is too small or large.
# Step 4: Remove events that have excessive noise in their side-bands.
    PostProcessInDecibelGroups: false
    # 1: Combine overlapping events
    CombineOverlappingEvents: true

    # 2: Combine possible syllable sequences

# Options to save results files
# 1: Available options for saving spectrograms (case-sensitive): [False/Never | True/Always | WhenEventsDetected]
# "True" is useful when debugging but "WhenEventsDetected" is required for operational use.
#SaveSonogramImages: True

# 2: Available options for saving data files (case-sensitive): [False/Never | True/Always | WhenEventsDetected]
SaveIntermediateWavFiles: Never

# 3: DisplayCsvImage is obsolete - ensure it remains set to: false
