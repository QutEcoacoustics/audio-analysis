#################### POST-PROCESSING of EVENTS ###################

PostProcessing:
  # # The following generic post-processing steps are determined by config settings.
  # # Step 1: Combine overlapping events - events derived from all profiles.
  # # Step 2: Combine possible syllable sequences and filter on excess syllable count.
  # # Step 3: Remove events whose bandwidth is too small or large.
  # # Step 4: Remove events that have excessive noise in their side-bands.

  #     # 1: Combine overlapping events
  #     CombineOverlappingEvents: true

  #     # 2: Combine possible syllable sequences
  SyllableSequence:
    CombinePossibleSyllableSequence: true

    SyllableHertzGap: 300
    FilterSyllableSequence: true
    SyllableMaxCount: 3
    ExpectedPeriod: 1.2

#     # 3: Remove events whose duration lies outside 3 SDs of an expected value.
#     #Duration:
#         ExpectedDuration: 0.14
#         DurationStandardDeviation: 0.01

#  #   Bandwidth:
#         ExpectedBandwidth: 280

#     # 5: Filter the events for excess activity in their sidebands, i.e. upper and lower buffer zones
