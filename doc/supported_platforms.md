# Supported Execution Platforms

## Execution

### Windows

The _AP.exe_ binary will run on any Windows computer with v4.6.2 of the .NET Framework installed.
Practically, it means that these variants are supported:

- Client SKUs
    - ✓ 10 Anniversary Update
    - + 10 November Update 
    - + 10 
    - + 8.1
    - + 7
- Server SKUs
    - ✓ 2016
    - + 2012 R2
    - + 2012
    - + 2008 R2 SP1

The ticks (✓) mean the framework can be installed, the plusses (+) indicate the framework should be installed.
The above was taken from <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/migration-guide/versions-and-dependencies>

### Unix

To run _AP.exe_ on Unix systems, the Mono runtime needs to be installed.
We require **Mono Version 5.5** or greater to be installed.

We support the following distributions:

- Ubuntu 16.04 (used in production)
- Debian 9 (not tested)
- Raspian (not tested)

To run a .NET Framework binary with Mono, simply prefix the command you would use on Windows with the `mono` keyword.
For example, in Windows:

```cmd
> AnalysisPrograms.exe list
```

In Linux:

```
$ mono AnalysisPrograms.exe list
```

### MacOS

Should the same as the Unix requirments, however, we have never run or tested the code on MacOS systems.
