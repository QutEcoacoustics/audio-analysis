## General

1. Choose what version of _AP.exe_ that you want
    - Stable: Well tested code, used on production servers, usually months old
    - Weekly: Automatic build based off the master branch.

        - Bleeding edge, very likely will break
1. Download a package
    - Click on the appropriate link
        - [Stable](https://github.com/QutBioacoustics/audio-analysis/releases/latest)

        - [Continuous](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/QUTEcoacousticsResearchGroup/audio-analysis/build/artifacts)
    - Download the _Release_ version - it will be a ZIP file that starts with _Release_
1. Extract the contents to a directory on your computer
    - It can be installed in any directory
