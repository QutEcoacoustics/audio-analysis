# Introduction To Running Commands

## You need a shell

On Windows we recommend using a PowerShell prompt, but CMD will also work.
On Unix systems any terminal, like BaSH will work.

## Example syntax

For examples of how to call the executable from the command line, we use the `$` symbol to denote a command line prompt. Do not type the `$` symbol yourself.

On Windows machines the standard prompt is a `>` character. We use a `$` sign in these examples only for consistency.

Special mentions:

- Powershell
    - All executables must be prefixed with a `./`
- Unix
    - All executions must be prefixed with `mono ` <-- note the space there

## Your first execution

In your shell, type the following and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

```
$ AnalysisPrograms.exe
```

This will produce several lines of output, including the program version number and instructions on how to set debug levels and verbosity. These options have sensible defaults and you do not need to change them.

## Seeing what _AP.exe_ can do

```
$ AnalysisPrograms.exe list
```

Will print a list of the available *actions*. Every action has an action-name by which it is invoked. Some actions perform acoustic analyses.

When constructing a command line, the first argument after the executable file name must be the action name, which will typically be followed by a list of options for that action:

```
$ AnalysisPrograms <action-name> [options...]
```

To obtain help with the options of a particular action, type:

```
$ AnalysisPrograms.exe help <action-name>
```

For example:

```
$ AnalysisPrograms.exe help audio2csv
```

In this command line, ‘help’ is an *action* and the action-name, *audio2csv*, is an option.

## Options

The command line options (all prefixed with a hyphen (`-`)), have a short and long form. The short form is always shown to the left of the long form and using either is equivalent. The value for the option should follow the option name, separated by a space. Use double quotes to group values together.

 We use long form options in this manual for clarity. See output from the `help` action for all options.

## Global options

Here is a short description of some of global options. As mentioned previously, you can ignore these options until you need them.

### Console and Log Verbosity

Verbosity of the logging output can be set by appending the `loglevel` options to the command line:

Valid verbosity values are:

-   `None` = 0 - show nothing
-   `Error` = 1 - show only errors
-   `Warn` = 2 - show only warnings
-   `Info` = 3 - the standard level
-   `Debug` = 4 - print some debug statements that show variable state and exta information
-   `Trace` = 5 - print many more debugging statements with detailed variable values
-   `Verbose` = 6 - print all stdout and stderr from associated tools
-   `All` = 7 - print absolutely everything

For example: `-l 4`, will give you the `debug` level of verbosity.

Alternatively, you can append one of the following switches to the command line:

-   `-v` Sets the logging to verbose. Equivalent to LogLevel = `Debug` = 4
-   `-vv` Sets the logging to very verbose. Equivalent to LogLevel = `Trace` = 5
-   `-vvv` Sets the logging to extremely verbose. Equivalent to LogLevel = `All` = 7

### Environment variables

- `AP_PLAIN_LOGGING`: `[true|false]`-- Enables simpler logging and no color output--the default is value is `false`
- [NOT YET IMPLEMENTED] `AP_DISABLE_METRICS` -- if defined will not send performance metrics back to the developers

## Beware these Syntax Gotchas**

-   **Never** finish a double quoted string argument with a backslash (\\). In particular, do not end directory names like this: “C:\\\\Path\\OutputDirectory\\”.
    The parsing rules for such cases are complicated and outside of our control. See [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.environment.getcommandlineargs.aspx) for details.
-   You can test arguments on Windows with the `echoargs.EXE` program
-   The arguments used are one of the first lines logged in _AP.exe_ log file
-   If an input argument is an array (e.g. directoryinfo\[\]), any commas in the       argument will delimit the values. For example, "Y:\\Results\\abc, 123,             doo-dah-dee" will be parsed as "Y:\\Results\\abc", " 123", " doo-dah-dee".
