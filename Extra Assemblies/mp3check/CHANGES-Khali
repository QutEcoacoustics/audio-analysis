* Extended support for id3 tags 1.0 and 1.1
  - Can now find more than one trailing tag.
  - Tag detector in start and end junk.
  - Possibility to remove the end junk without removing the trailing tag.
  - Possibility to remove the trailing tag.
  - Declares the tag and its version in -c and -l if width allows it.
  - Tag dumper, displaying the tag contents and some useful information
    (version, conformance to the specification).

* Minor improvements or changes
  - VERSION defined by default to "undefined :(" to prevent compilation
    failure when compiling "by hand".
  - Columns count detection, to adapt the display to the terminal width.
  - Separation of code and headers in crc16.h (thus creating a new file,
    crc16.cc).
  - "single ligne" fix for errors (such as "not a mpeg 1.0/2.0") in -l and
    -c modes.
  - Count of checked files fixed (was too high due to multiple pass on
    cut-junk-end, cut-junk-start and now cut-tag-end.
  - Considered 128kbps as the only normal bitrate (112kbps streams are
    quite rare nowadays).
  - Considered the copyright bit being set as normal, since having
    copyrighted files may be legal if it's your own work or if you
    own the original copy.
  - Added a Makefile.BSD for building with non-GNU make.
  - Now never says "1 bytes".

* Planed but not yet implemented
  - Filenames filtering.
  - Rewriting of the retrying mecanism, to avoid doing the same test many
    times.
  - Tag fixer.
  - Last frame completion.
