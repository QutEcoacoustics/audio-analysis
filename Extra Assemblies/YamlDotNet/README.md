These dlls were only added because of a bug in the source library.

When https://github.com/aaubry/YamlDotNet/pull/92, https://github.com/aaubry/YamlDotNet/pull/95 is merged, these packages should be added back in via nuget (when project is updates nuget packages).

Additionally, trying out a serializeable version of the library. Custom build again.
Currently using: https://github.com/antmt/YamlDotNet/tree/serializable
