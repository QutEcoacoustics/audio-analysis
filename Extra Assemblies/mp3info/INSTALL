Installing the Windows version
==============================

There really is no formal installation procedure.  MP3Info is a single
executable that has no dependencies and uses no registry entries.
If you want to make mp3info available from anywhere on your system,
you can copy mp3info.exe to a directory in your system path.
This command would do the trick:

	copy mp3info.exe %SYSTEMROOT%



Installing MP3info from source (UNIX)
=====================================

Unpack and decompress the archive file, then change the current working
directory to the directory created by unpacking the archive.  The following
two commands should accomplish this:

	tar -xzvf mp3info-x.y.tgz
	cd mp3info-x.y
	
Next, edit the top of the Makefile and make any changes necessary to reflect 
your environment. The defaults are valid for Red Hat and Fedora Linux systems, 
but will probably work for many others.

Next, run the following two commands.

	make
	make install 		(this command must be run by the root user)

If you want to install just the console version use:

	make mp3info
	make install-mp3info    (this command must be run by the root user)

If you want to install just the GTK version use:

	make gmp3info
	make install-gmp3info   (this command must be run by the root user)

... and that's it. There should be a binary named mp3info and/or another named 
gmp3info in /usr/local/bin (or whatever you changed the 'prefix' variable to 
in the Makefile).



Troubleshooting 
===============

If 'make install' results in an error like the following:

     install: cannot create regular file `/usr/local/man/man1/mp3info.1': No such file or directory
     
you probably need to go back and edit the 'manpath' setting in the Makefile.  
The manpath variable must reflect one of your system's repositories for manual 
pages -- specifically for section 1 manual pages (so specifying /foo/bar/man 
would not be sufficient -- you would need to specify /foo/bar/man/man1 or 
/foo/bar/man/sman1 or whatever reflects reality).

If you have trouble determining where your system's man pages are stored, try 
examining your MANPATH environment variable or see man's own man page (i.e run 
'man 1 man').


Installing the pre-compiled binaries
====================================

Run the following command as the root user.  Note that you must have the 
RedHat Package Manager (RPM) installed.  If you don't have RPM installed on 
your system, you can get it from the RedHat web site (www.redhat.com), but you 
will probably find it easier just to build from source code.

	rpm -ivh mp3info-x.y-z.i386.rpm
	
If you are upgrading from a previous version of MP3Info, use this command:

	rpm -Uvh mp3info-x.y-z.i386.rpm
