# Spectrograms

A spectrogram is processed as a matrix of real values but visualized as a grey-scale image. Each row of pixels is a frequency bin and each column of pixels is a time-frame. The value in each spectrogram/matrix cell (represented visually by one image pixel) is the acoustic intensity in decibels with respect to the background noise baseline. Note that the decibel values in a noise-reduced spectrogram are always positive.
