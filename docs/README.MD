# QUT Ecoacoustics: AnalysisPrograms.exe manual


*QUT Ecoacoustics Analysis Programs* is a software package that can perform a 
suite of analyses on audio recordings of the environment. Although the analyses
are intended for long-duration recordings (1 – 24 hours approx), in fact they
can be performed on any audio file in a format supported by the software.
Typically, you would not use the software to analyse recordings shorter than one
 minute. Currently the software performs:

- calculation of summary and spectral acoustic indices at variable resolutions
- produces long-duration, false-colour, multi-index spectrograms
- can calculate critical statistics of annotations downloaded from an Acoustic Workbench
- is capable of running various acoustic event recognizers

All the analyses are performed by a single executable file, _AnalysisPrograms.exe_ (henceforth abbreviated to _AP.exe_), with command-line arguments determining what analyses are to be done and on which files.
