# The Help command

The easiest and most up to date way of getting help for a command is to use
the _help_ command or the `--help` option.

For example:

```bash
AnalysisPrograms.exe --help
```

To see all the available commands, run:

```bash
AnalysisPrograms.exe --list
```

To get help for a specific command (in this case `audio2csv`), run:

```bash
AnalysisPrograms.exe audio2csv --help
```
