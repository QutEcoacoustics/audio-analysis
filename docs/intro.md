*QUT Ecoacoustics Analysis Programs* is a software package that can perform a  suite of analyses on audio recordings of
the environment. Although the analyses are intended for long-duration recordings (1 â€“ 24 hours), in fact they
can be performed on any audio file in a format supported by the software. Analysis Programs can:

- calculate of summary and spectral acoustic indices at variable resolutions
- produce long-duration, false-colour, multi-index spectrograms
- calculate critical statistics of annotations downloaded from an Acoustic Workbench
- run various acoustic event recognizers

All the analyses are performed by a single executable file, _AnalysisPrograms.exe_.

The project is open source and licensed under the Apache License 2.0.
