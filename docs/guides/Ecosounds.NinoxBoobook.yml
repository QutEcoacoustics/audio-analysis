#################### POST-PROCESSING of EVENTS ###################

PostProcessing:
    # The following generic post-processing steps are determined by config settings.
    # Step 1: Combine overlapping events - events derived from all profiles.
    # Step 2: Combine possible syllable sequences and filter on excess syllable count.
    # Step 3: Remove events whose duration is too small or large.
    # Step 4: Remove events whose bandwidth is too small or large.
    # Step 5: Remove events that have excessive noise in their side-bands.

    # 1: Combine overlapping events
    CombineOverlappingEvents: true

    # 2: Combine possible syllable sequences
    SyllableSequence:
        SyllableStartDifference: 0.6
        SyllableHertzGap: 350
        FilterSyllableSequence: true
        SyllableMaxCount: 2
        ExpectedPeriod: 0.4

    # 3: Remove events whose duration lies outside 3 SDs of an expected value.
    #Duration:
    #    ExpectedDuration: 0.14
    #    DurationStandardDeviation: 0.01

    # 4: Remove events whose bandwidth lies outside 3 SDs of an expected value.
    Bandwidth:
        ExpectedBandwidth: 280
        BandwidthStandardDeviation: 40

    # 5: Filter the events for excess activity in their sidebands
